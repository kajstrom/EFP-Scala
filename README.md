[![Tracis CI](https://travis-ci.org/kajstrom/EFP-Scala.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kajstrom/EFP-Scala)

My solutions in Scala for exercises from the book [Exercises for Programmers](https://pragprog.com/book/bhwb/exercises-for-programmers).

## Todo
- Exercise 25 might be useful to revise with a more advanced solution
- Exercise 26 was skipped, the math was a bit too intensive.
- Exercise 32: Better solution for return correct/high/low guesses. Currently integer codes. Enumeration?
- Exercise 49: Creating thumbnails, showing multiple images at once, showing the search form after searching.
